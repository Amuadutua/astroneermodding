General Information
-------------------

All mods are Unreal Engine 4 .pak files. The .pak file format is used by the Unreal Engine for storing large amounts of data in a compact space. 
When placed into the ``%localappdata%\Astro\Saved\Paks`` directory, these .pak files are loaded by Astroneer as patches, or partial replacements, 
of the main game assets found in the ``Astro-WindowsNoEditor.pak`` file.
